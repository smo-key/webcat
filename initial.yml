### Initial Web Cache
#
# Pages that match these urls will be scraped and cached - others will be ignored
# ONE PAGE URL PER LINE, first line gets highest priority
#
# To cache all pages, just type *
# Add specific pages to locate and cache them immediately on startup (you can add a * afterward)
# This list is modifyable at runtime with webcat.add([regex]), webcat.remove([regex])
